For each of the following assets, assign a low, moderate, or high impact level for the loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity, respectively. Justify your answers.

a. An organization managing public information on its Web server.

b. A law enforcement organization managing extremely sensitive investigative information.

c. A financial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy related information).

d. An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting organization contains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine administrative information. Assess the impact for the two data sets separately and the information system as a whole.

e. A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information. Assess the impact for the two data sets separately and the information system as a whole.

e                 high                  low                 high

Analyse:

a. Because the information is public and for Web server, so provide network services is the most important. And the requirements for integrity and confidentiality are relatively less strict.
b. The information is extremely sensitive which is used for a law enforcement organization. So ensuring confidentiality and integrity comes first.
c. It is not privacy related information and just for routine administrative. So no high requirements for it.
d. The information contains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine administrative information. Disclosure or tampering of information can lead to serious financial losses.
